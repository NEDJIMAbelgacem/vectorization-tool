# vectorization-tool
Basic tool to vectorize 2D maps

This tool was developed as my SIGA (systemes d'information geographique avancee - advanced geographical information systems) course project.
This app functions are :
- Displaying images that represents a map.
- Adding shapes over that image like points, line, polylines and polygons in order to display as a road or boundaries of a country for example.
- You can delete and update the existing shapes.
- You can export the scene as an XML file
- You can read the scene from an XML file
- You can change the color and the thickness of shapes
- You can specify topology conditions like :
  - a shape should be inside or outside another selected shape.
  - a shape should intersect with another selected shape.
  - a shape should be in the neighbourhood of another selected shape.

The application was made using C++ and QT
